<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>To start off, if you didn't catch my drift, my name is Emilia Rosa Magana and I'm so happy have a strong support system by my side. I actually didn't think about 
coding until my junior year of highschool. 
My primary subject was accounting for my business class, and took some programming languages on the side for fun. I'll be honest, it didn't 
inspire me to become a programmer at first, but it did spark an interest in marketing. In today's economy, let's just say that nothing is affortable anymore, so 
onto programming it is.</p>

<p>Programming after highschool has brought me closer to family and being more involved throughout my community. I'm so excited to discover 
  what I can do for this world and what I'm going to create to help make it better.
